# Changelog

## [0.0.34] - "Commit 34 - Commit 34/2" - 2023/11/05

### Removed
- Several methods have been removed from the `Board` class that were considered less necessary in the current context of the Scrabble game. The retired methods are the following:
  - `place_tile`: This method has been removed, as the responsibilities related to tile and letter placement have been redistributed more efficiently to other methods and classes.
  - `validate_word`: The word validation method has been removed, as its functionality has been integrated and optimized elsewhere in the code.
  - `validate_word_out_of_board`: The out-of-board word validation method has been removed, as it is no longer considered necessary in the context of the game.
  - `clear_cell`: The function to clear a cell has been removed, as it was not required in the current game flow.
These changes were made with the aim of simplifying and optimizing the code structure, eliminating functionalities that were no longer relevant to the operation of the game.

### Added
- Added `convert_result_to_list_of_words` method. This method allows you to convert the result of an operation into a list of words. The result is provided in the form of nested lists, and this new method extracts and returns the first word from each list.
- A new class called `ScrabbleUtils` has been created in the `utils.py` file, which includes a series of useful methods to perform various operations related to the Scrabble game. These methods make it easier to manage and calculate scores and validations in the game:
- `are_cells_around_word_valid`: Checks if the cells around a word are valid.
- `is_letter_multiplier_active`: Checks if a letter multiplier is active in a cell.
- `is_word_multiplier_active`: Checks if a word multiplier is active in a cell.
- `calculate_word_value`: Calculates the value of a word, considering the letter and word multipliers.
- `generate_positions`: Generates the positions of the cells of a word based on their location and orientation.
- `collect_tiles_for_word`: Collects the tiles present in the cells of a word.
- `determine_required_tiles`: Determines the tiles needed to complete a word, taking into account the tiles already placed on the board.

## [0.0.33] - "Commit 33" - 2023/11/03

### Added
- Several methods have been added to the `Board` class:
  - `process_tile_and_letter`: This method processes a tile and a letter, using `Utils` to compare them. If they do not match (return value 0), the letter is added to a list. If they match (return value 1), the letter is added to another list.
  - `check_word_conditions`: This method checks the conditions of the lists generated by `process_tile_and_letter`. If the list of unmatched letters (0) is not empty, it returns False. If both lists are empty (that is, all letters match), returns True.
  - `horizontal_border_cells`: This method identifies the cells on the horizontal border of a word.
  - `vertical_border_cells`: Identifies the cells on the vertical border of a word.
  - `cells_around_horizontal_word`: Determines the cells around a word placed horizontally.
  - `cells_around_vertical_word`: Determines the cells around a word placed vertically.
  - `find_cells_around_word`: Unifies obtaining cells around a word according to their orientation (horizontal or vertical).
  - `find_tiles_around_word`: Calculates tiles around a word and their orientation, taking into account adjacent cells.
- New methods have been added to the `Utils` class:
  - `compare_tiles_and_letters`: This method compares a tile and a letter, and returns 1 if they match, 0 if there is no tile or they do not match.
  - `remove_duplicate_columns`: Remove duplicates in a list of tuples, keeping only one entry for each column (according to the Y coordinate).
  - `remove_duplicate_rows`: Similar to the previous method, removes duplicates in a list of tuples, keeping only one entry for each row (according to the X coordinate).
- Tests for each added method were added

### Changed
- Moved the `word_to_tiles` method to the `Utils` class in `utils.py`, along with its respective test in `test_utils.py`.
- Improvements and modifications were made to several methods of the `Board` class to improve its operation and ensure proper validation of words and placement on the board:
  - `validate_word_inside_board`: The validation of words within the board has been optimized, guaranteeing their correct placement.
  - `word_in_the_center`: Made adjustments to check words relative to the center of the board.
  - `validate_word_horizontal`: Implemented improvements to word validation in the horizontal direction.
  - `validate_word_vertical`: Improvements were made to word validation in the vertical direction.
  - `validate_word_place-board`: Adjustments and improvements were made to word placement validation on the board.
  - Updated and improved the corresponding tests in `test_board.py` to reflect these changes and ensure the methods work correctly.

   - `test_clear_cell_invalid`: Checks that the `clear_cell` function returns `False` when attempting to clear a cell outside the board's boundaries. The cell outside the boundaries should not be modified.

## [0.0.17] - "Diecisieteavo Commit" - 2023/09/22

### Added
- Added `pass_turn` method to allow the player to pass their turn. This method ends the player's current turn.
- Added `check_tile_in_hand(tile)` method to check if a specific tile is present in the player's hand. It verifies if the tile exists in the player's current set of tiles.
- Added `get_hand_size` method to retrieve the current size of the player's hand, i.e., the number of tiles the player holds.
- Added `get_score` method to calculate the player's score based on played tiles on the board. It calculates the score by summing the values of the played tiles, considering any multipliers.
- Added `validate_word(word)` method to validate if a given word can be formed with the tiles in the player's hand. It checks if all the letters required for the word are present in the player's hand.
- Added `MockCell` class to simulate game cells for testing purposes:
   - `__init__(self, value)`: Initializes a MockCell instance with a specified value.
   - `calculate_value(self)`: Simulates calculating the value of the cell, returning the specified value.
- Added tests for the new methods:
   - `test_pass_turn`: Verifies that the player can pass their turn successfully.
   - `test_check_tile_in_hand`: Tests if the method correctly identifies tiles present in the player's hand.
   - `test_get_hand_size`: Ensures that the method returns the correct number of tiles in the player's hand.
   - `test_get_score_no_played_cells`: Tests the calculation of the player's score when no cells have been played on the board.
   - `test_get_score_with_played_cells`: Tests the calculation of the player's score when cells with values have been played on the board.
   - `test_validate_word_valid`: Checks if the validate_word method correctly validates a valid word.
   - `test_validate_word_invalid`: Tests the validate_word method to confirm it correctly identifies an invalid word.

### Note
- There are two definitions of MockCell in the codebase. The first definition is within the MockBoard class, used to simulate the game board's cells. The second definition is outside the MockBoard class and is used in test cases to simulate cells played on the board for scoring calculations. The reason for having two MockCell definitions is to separate their roles: one for simulating the board and the other for simulating played cells.
